# discordBot

This Discord Bot was made to get Covid-19 statistics.

Invite bot here: [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=731054408091041793&permissions=0&scope=bot).

All commands need to have "." as the prefix for them to work. Ex: for the command "stateTotal", the full 
command is: `.stateTotal [state]`. You replace `[state]` with the name of the state. \
If the state is two words you will need to place it in quotation marks. Ex: `.stateTotal "North Carolina"`




| Commands |  Actions |
|----------|----------
| firsEvent [state]  | give the date of the first case |
| previousDays [state] | gives the total of new cases for the past days given |
| stateTotal [state] | gives total number of cases for the state. |
| commandList | sends user a DM with the list of commands |
