# discordBot

This Discord Bot was made to get Covid-19 statistics.

All commands need to have "." as the prefix for them to work. Ex: for the command "stateTotal", the full 
command is: `.stateTotal [state]`. You replace `[state]` with the name of the state. \
If the state is two words you will need to place it in quotation marks. Ex: `.stateTotal "North Carolina"`



| Commands |  Actions |
|----------|----------
| firsEvent [state]  | give the date of the first case |
| previousDays [state] | gives the total of new cases for the past days given |
| stateTotal [state] | gives total number of cases for the state. |

** This project is a continuation of the Covid-Statistics project. Data used comes from [the NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).
